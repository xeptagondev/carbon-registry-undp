                No. The open-source code is publicly available, as a starting point to help
                countries adapt and build their own national Registries. All country-specific
                registries and data, once built, are hosted and secured by each government. Each
                country is responsible for managing its own system in line with national data
                protection laws. Data access and sharing are entirely up to each government.

                The Registry is designed to be fully customizable. Countries typically start each
                process by defining their countries’ needs and determining what needs to be changed
                from the demo system. Countries have already adapted the platform to fit a wide
                variety of contexts, including:

                  <span>
                    Offers scalability, integrated security, and ease of backup and maintenance.
                    Hosting on AWS (via a government-owned account) allows countries to fully
                    leverage QLDB with minimal configuration changes.

                  <span>
                    Countries can choose to install the software on government-managed servers or
                    preferred cloud platforms to maintain full control over data, access, and
                    security. Local IT teams will be responsible for ongoing maintenance,
                    configuration, and backups.

                    Countries may opt to integrate blockchain-based encryption and distributed
