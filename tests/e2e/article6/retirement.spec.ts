/**
 * E2E coverage for credit retirement via the two-phase
 * /retireRequest -> /performRetireAction flow on
 * /national/creditTransactionsManagement.
 *
 * Backs audit gaps #6 (Major), #9 (Major) and #10 (Major) from
 * docs/testing/e2e-coverage.md. Prior to this file the retirement
 * surface was only exercised by a bundle-scan smoke test
 * (itmo-lifecycle:189) and a single CASL rejection
 * (itmo-lifecycle:599). The arithmetic side-effects — overdraw
 * rejection, post-retirement re-retirement, and the six-way
 * retirement-type -> accountType mapping — were unasserted.
 *
 * Backend flow verified against:
 *   - credit.transactions.management.controller.ts:39-64 (2 routes:
 *     /retireRequest for phase 1, /performRetireAction for phase 2).
 *   - credit-transactions-management.service.ts:181-278 (createRetireRequest)
 *     and :280-397 (creditRetirementAction).
 *   - programme-ledger.service.ts:56-78 (mapRetirementTypeToAccountType)
 *     and :671-982 (addRetireRequest + retirementRequestAction).
 *
 * Infrastructure notes:
 *   - The ledger-replicator container is Exited in the current dev
 *     stack. phase 2 (/performRetireAction) depends on a row in the
 *     RDBMS credit_transactions_entity table, which is normally
 *     populated by the replicator via handleTransactionRecords
 *     (credit-transactions-management.service.ts:399-511 + called from
 *     ledger-replicator/process.event.service.ts:366). We bypass the
 *     replicator by inserting the pending transaction row directly
 *     via seedPendingRetirementTransactionDirect so the ACCEPT branch
 *     can reach the ledger update.
 *   - queryBalance filters out retired blocks (view WHERE ownerCompanyId
 *     != 0), so accountType assertions read the ledger credit_blocks
 *     table directly via readLedgerBlocksByProject / readLedgerCreditBlock.
 *
 * Parallel safety: every seeded block / tx uses uniqueSuffix().
