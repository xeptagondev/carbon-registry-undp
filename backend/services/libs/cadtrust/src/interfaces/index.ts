/**
 * CAD Trust v2 sync-event data interfaces — barrel export.
 *
 * Insert order (dependency order for staging records so foreign keys resolve —
 * per the source doc's "Data Model Overview" section):
 *
 *   program -> methodology -> stakeholder -> label -> project ->
 *   project_methodology -> stakeholder_projects -> validation -> verification ->
 *   location -> estimation -> rating -> co_benefit -> issuance -> unit -> unit_label
 *
 * AEF insert order (only if Article 6.2 reporting applies):
 *
 *   aef_t5_authorized_entities and/or aef_t1_submission -> aef_t2_authorizations ->
 *   aef_t3_actions / aef_t4_holdings
 *
 * Every entity below stages a change only; nothing is published to the network
 * until actions/staging.ts's commit flow runs. See common.ts for the shared
 * conventions (staging model, orgUid handling, picklist handling, PUT = full
 * replace) that apply across every file in this package.
