/**
 * Which CAD Trust resource a sync record points at.
 *
 * Values match the keys of `RESOURCES` in `@app/cadtrust`'s
 * `resources/registry.ts`, so a handler can look the endpoint up from a sync row
 * — except `ORGANIZATION`, which is not a `RESOURCES` entry: it is the node's own
 * network identity, reached through the `organizations` action client rather
 * than a CRUD resource.
 *
 * String-valued — see the note in cadtrust.sync.status.enum.ts.
