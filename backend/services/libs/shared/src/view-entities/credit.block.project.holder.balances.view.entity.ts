// Credits -> Balance -> By Project (Project Developer): one row per
// (project, holder) pair, aggregating the balance (creditAmount -
// reservedCreditAmount) and reserved amount of every non-retired block a
// given organization holds within a given project. A Project Developer
// queries this filtered to holderId = own companyId, yielding one row per
// project it holds credits in, scoped strictly to its own holdings -
// unlike CreditBlockProjectBalancesViewEntity (DNA), which sums across all
// holders. projectOwner* still identifies the project's developer company,
// which may differ from the current holder. updatedTime is the most recent
// block update (txTime) within the (project, holder) scope. Ignores
// account type by design - totals cover all account types.
