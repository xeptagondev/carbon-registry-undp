/**
 * `AsyncActionType` is a numeric enum persisted as a Postgres enum whose labels
 * are the ordinals as strings. Two things break if a member is inserted or
 * reordered rather than appended:
 *
 *  - every existing `async_action_entity` row silently changes meaning, and
 *  - the labels created by `src/migrations/1785500000000-CadTrustV2Sync.ts`
 *    ('17', '18', '19') stop matching the members they were created for.
 *
 * Neither failure is visible at compile time, hence this test. If it fails, do
 * not update the numbers here — move the new member to the end of the enum
 * instead, and add its label in a new migration.
