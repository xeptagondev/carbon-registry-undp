/**
 * Verifies the CAD Trust home organization and stages this registry's one
 * program and one methodology, once.
 *
 * ## Organization: verified, never created
 *
 * Creating a CAD Trust organization is node onboarding, not a registry sync
 * action — it can take up to ~30 minutes and builds the node's own blockchain
 * datalayer stores. `organizations.waitForCreation()` exists in `@app/cadtrust`
 * for exactly that, but it MUST NOT be called from here: this handler runs
 * inside the single-cursor async consumer (see `CadTrustSyncHandler`'s class
 * doc), and a 30-minute block would stall every queued action behind it,
 * outgoing email included. If no home organization exists, this handler
 * records that and stops — an operator provisions the organization
 * out-of-band, the same way they point `CADT_V2_BASE_URL` at a node.
 *
 * ## Program and methodology: staged, then committed inline — not queued
 *
 * Staging still only writes to the node's private staging table, same as
 * everywhere else in this adaptor. But unlike `CadTrustProjectCreateHandler`,
 * which enqueues a separate `CADTV2Commit` action so several projects created
 * back-to-back batch into one on-chain commit, this handler calls
 * `CadTrustCommitHandler.handle()` directly, in the same run. Bootstrap runs
 * once per national-api start — there is nothing else in flight to batch
 * with — so queueing would only add a full extra round trip (another
 * `async_action_entity` row, another pass of the consumer loop) before the
 * program and methodology are actually published. Calling the handler
 * in-process is safe here because it already satisfies the same never-throw
 * contract this class does.
 *
 * ## Idempotent by design, not by trigger suppression
 *
 * This is enqueued once per national-api start (see `main.ts`), deliberately —
 * see the enqueue service. `CadTrustSyncRecordService.isAlreadySynced` is what
 * makes repeat runs cheap once bootstrap has succeeded.
