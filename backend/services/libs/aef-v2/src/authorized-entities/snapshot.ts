 * an Authorized entity, before this year's snapshot has run at all — and this
 * function is the only place that would otherwise collide with it. For every
 * entity the provider computes, an existing unfrozen row sharing its
 * `aefT5AuthorizedEntitiesId` is updated in place (fresh field values plus
 * `snapshotAt`) instead of a second row being created. Any unfrozen row left
 * over after that — one the provider's own live query didn't independently
 * return, e.g. because the entity's `authorizationDate` is unset — is frozen
